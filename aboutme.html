                <h2>Personal Background</h2>
                <p> I was born in Boston, Massachucetts and raised in Los Angeles, California. 
                    I am a first-generation female immigrant from a Persian-American background. 
                    I am Bilingual in Farsi and English. Farsi is my first language, but Emglish 
                    is my primary language. Being both a product of diversity and an advocate for 
                    it, I’ve learned how to communicate across cultures, value different 
                    perspectives, and adapt in inclusive environments. These experiences shape 
                    how I connect with people, lead teams, and solve problems. </p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p> I am currently pursuing a double Bachelor of Science in Computer Science 
                    and Statistics at California State University, Northridge (CSUN), where 
                    I hold a 3.7 GPA. My journey began at El Camino Real Charter High School, 
                    where I discovered my passion for computer science after taking my first 
                    CS class in junior year. During high school, I also performed in the 
                    Percussion Ensemble and Marching Band, playing several instruments — 
                    with the marimba being my favorite. After graduating in 2020, I attended 
                    Los Angeles Pierce College for three years, building a strong foundation 
                    in computer science and math before transferring to CSUN. Encouraged by 
                    a statistics professor during my first semester, I decided to pursue a 
                    second major in statistics.</p>
